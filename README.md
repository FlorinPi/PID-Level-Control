# PID-Level-Control
This project is part of the Industrial Process Control Systems laboratory and uses the level control installation for the identification and regulation of a real physical process.

The main goal is to model, simulate, and implement a discrete PID controller for regulating the water level in a tank.

The project includes:
- Experimental identification of the level process using step response tests
- Data filtering and determination of the equivalent mathematical model
- Building the Simulink model and testing the PID controller
- Implementing the control law on the physical platform
- Analyzing system behavior under disturbances and verifying robustness
